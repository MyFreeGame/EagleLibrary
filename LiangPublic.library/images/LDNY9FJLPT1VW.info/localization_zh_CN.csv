"ToS_01","1. About these terms"
"ToS_01.1","1.1 These terms create a legal agreement between you (“you” or “your”) and King.com Limited of Aragon Business Centre Level 4, Dragonara Road, St Julians STJ3140, Malta, a company registered in Malta with registration number C42504 (“King”, “we”, “us” or “our”) in relation to your download, access and/or use of King games (each a “Game” and together the “Games”). These terms also apply to any other services that we may provide in relation to the Games, such as customer support, social media, community channels and other websites that we may operate from time to time (we refer to all our Games and other services collectively as the \"Services\" in these terms). You agree that by downloading and/or accessing our Services, you are agreeing to these terms and our Privacy Policy (see paragraph 10 below). If you do not agree to these terms or any future updated version of them then you must not access and/or use, and must cease all access and/or use of, any of our Services. If we require that any future update to these terms requires any action from you in order to accept the updated terms, then you may not be able to continue to use the Services until you have taken such action."
"ToS_01.2","1.2 These terms apply to those of our players who are resident in Korea; if you are resident in another country then a different set of terms applies to you.  You can access the latest update of all country-specific versions of our terms, including these terms, at any time by visiting http://about.king.com/consumer-terms/ and selecting the flag corresponding to the country in which you are resident."
"ToS_01.3","1.3 You agree that you are at least 14 years old and that if you are between 14 years old and 19 years old, your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these terms and is happy for you to access and/or use our Services."
"ToS_01.4","1.4 We can make changes to these terms at any time in accordance with paragraph 14 below and your continued use of our Services shall confirm your acceptance of the updated terms."
"ToS_02","2. About accessing and using our Services"
"ToS_02.1","2.1 The specific game rules, scoring rules, controls and guidelines for each Game can be found within the Game itself. Such rules, scoring rules, controls and guidelines form part of these terms and you agree that you shall comply with them in respect of each individual Game which you choose to access and/or play."
"ToS_02.2","2.2 You are responsible for the internet connection and/or mobile charges that you may incur for accessing and/or using our Services. You should ask your mobile operator or internet service provider if you are unsure what these charges will be, before you play."
"ToS_02.3","2.3 We have the right to withdraw or modify one or more of our Services (in whole or in part) without liability to you from time to time:
•	for technical reasons (such as technical difficulties experienced by us or on the internet);
•	to allow us to improve user experience; 
•	where we have legal reasons for doing so (including privacy, data protection or other legal objections to the content or conduct of our Services); 
•	because it no longer makes business sense for us to provide the relevant Services (in whole or in part); or
•	because we have altered the services we provide."
"ToS_02.4","2.4 There may also be times when our Services or any part of them are not available for technical or maintenance related reasons, whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis."
"ToS_03","3. Accounts"
"ToS_03.1","3.1 When using our Services you may choose to, and in some instances you will be required to, create an account with us.  If you do create an account with us, you agree that you shall take all steps necessary to protect your log in details and keep them secret."
"ToS_03.2","3.2 You agree that you shall not give your log in details to anyone else or allow anyone else to use your log in details or account."
"ToS_03.3","3.3 In these terms, references to “log in details” or “account” include your log in details and account for any social network that you may allow our Services to interact with."
"ToS_03.4","3.4 We will be entitled to assume that anyone logging into your account using your log in details is either you or someone logging in with your permission. If you fail to keep your login details secret, or if you share your login details or account with someone else (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any unauthorized purchases) and agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result."
"ToS_03.5","3.5 We will not be responsible to you for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorised person accessing your account and/or using our Services and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorised use, whether fraudulently or otherwise."
"ToS_03.6","3.6 We reserve the right to delete your account if no activity is conducted by you in relation to the account for 180 or more days. In such event, you will no longer be able to access and/or use any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods (as defined below) associated with that account and no refund will be offered to you in relation to the same."
"ToS_03.7","3.7 You understand that if you delete your account, or if we delete your account in accordance with these terms or on your request, you may lose access to any data previously associated with your account (including without limitation, your progress through our Games and/or the level or score you have reached in our Games and any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods associated with your account)."
"ToS_03.8","3.8 Your account is personal to you and you are not entitled to transfer your account to any other person."
"ToS_04","4. Virtual Goods and Virtual Money"
"ToS_04.1","4.1 Our Games may include virtual currencies such as Gold Bars (“Virtual Money”) or items or services for use with our Games (“Virtual Goods”). You can buy Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods from us for real money and/or other credits provided that you are the payment account holder. If you are not at least 19 years old, you hereby acknowledge and agree that you have obtained consent from your legal representative for the purchase. You agree that Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods are not transferrable to anyone else and you will not transfer or attempt to transfer any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods to anyone else."
"ToS_04.2","4.2 You agree that once purchased Virtual Money and Virtual Goods have no monetary value and can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else."
"ToS_04.3","4.3 You do not own Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money but instead you purchase a limited personal revocable licence to use them. Any balance of Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money does not reflect any stored value."
"ToS_04.4","4.4 If you do not connect your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or a King account, we will not be able to restore any Virtual Money or other data associated with your Game play to a different device if you lose that device or it is damaged. Accordingly, on a device which is not connected in this way:
•	any risk of loss of Virtual Money which you purchase from us is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase. For the purposes of this paragraph 4.4 and paragraph 4.5 below, a \"purchase\" is complete at the time our servers validate your purchase and the applicable Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money are successfully credited to your account on our servers; 
•	any risk of loss of Virtual Money that you receive from us without making a purchase is transferred to you at the time the Virtual Money is successfully credited to your account on our servers; and
•	any risk of loss of other data associated with your Game play (including, without limitation, your progress through the Game, or the level or score you have reached in our Games) is transferred to you immediately at the time such Game play data is generated."
"ToS_04.5","4.5 The data associated with Virtual Goods, whether purchased by you using Virtual Money or otherwise credited or awarded to you, is stored locally on your device and so is not synced between different devices even if you have connected your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or King account.  Accordingly, any risk of loss of this data is transferred to you (i) in the case of Virtual Goods which you purchase from us, upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.4 above; and/or (ii) in other cases, at the time the Virtual Goods are credited or awarded to you."
"ToS_04.6","4.6 We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you."
"ToS_04.7","4.7 We may revise the pricing for Virtual Goods and Virtual Money offered through the Services at any time. We may limit the total amount of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods that may be held in your account in the aggregate. You are only allowed to obtain Virtual Money and Virtual Goods from us or our authorized partners through the Games, and not in any other way."
"ToS_04.8","4.8 Depending on your platform, any Virtual Goods or Virtual Money purchased is purchased from your platform provider and such purchase will be subject to its terms of service and user agreement. Usage rights for each purchase may differ from item to item. If you are unsure about usage rights you should check with your platform before making a purchase. Unless otherwise shown, content available in any in-game store has the same age rating as the game."
"ToS_04.9","4.9 Without limiting any other paragraph of these terms, if we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with paragraph 7 of these terms you may lose any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you."
"ToS_04.99","4.10 Refund Policy
For a period of 7 days from the date of a purchase of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods using real money (a “Purchase Transaction”), you have a right to request a refund of the purchase price; provided, however, that if any or all of the Virtual Money or Virtual Goods bought in a Purchase Transaction is used within the 7 day period following the Purchase Transaction, you will no longer have a right to request a refund of purchase price for that Purchase Transaction. 
Further, if the Virtual Money or Virtual Goods bought in a Purchase Transaction are bundled with other additional Virtual Goods and some or all of those additional Virtual Goods are used, then you will no longer have the right to request a refund of the purchase price for that Purchase Transaction.
If at any time you receive any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without payment by you, for instance as a prize or gift, that Virtual Money or Virtual Goods will not be refundable or otherwise capable of being exchanged for real money.
Refunds can be requested through our customer care portal available at https://community.king.com and will be made via the payment partner through which the original purchase was made. The applicable Virtual Money and Virtual Goods which are the subject of a refund request may be removed from your account before the refund is processed."

You may be able to (i) choose to play against another person or play socially with another person whom King selects for you, or (ii) play against, or play socially with, one of your contacts on a platform or social network which you have allowed our Games to interact with. Some of our Games may also allow you to search for your contacts (for example, by email address) in order to find them to play against or play socially with. We may also display the display names of your past opponents so that you can easily find them to play again."
"ToS_06.2","6.2 Where King selects another person for you to play with, we may either select at random or use such criteria as we see fit to select your opponent (for example, your past scores, your country, the level you have reached in the Game or your other gameplay activity)."

1. About these terms

1.1 These terms create a legal agreement between you (“you” or “your”) and King.com Limited of Aragon Business Centre Level 4, Dragonara Road, St Julians STJ3140, Malta, a company registered in Malta with registration number C42504 (“King”, “we”, “us” or “our”) in relation to your download, access and/or use of King games (each a “Game” and together the “Games”). These terms also apply to any other services that we may provide in relation to the Games, such as customer support, social media, community channels and other websites that we may operate from time to time (we refer to all our Games and other services collectively as the ”Services” in these terms). You agree that by downloading and/or accessing our Services, you are agreeing to these terms and our Privacy Policy (see paragraph 10 below). If you do not agree to these terms or any future updated version of them then you must not access and/or use, and must cease all access and/or use of, any of our Services. If we require that any future update to these terms requires any action from you in order to accept the updated terms, then you may not be able to continue to use the Services until you have taken such action.

^1.2 These terms apply to those of our players who are resident in Korea; if you are resident in another country then a different set of terms applies to you.  You can access the latest update of all country-specific versions of our terms, including these terms, at any time by visiting http://about.king.com/consumer-terms/ and selecting the flag corresponding to the country in which you are resident.

1.3 You agree that you are at least 14 years old and that if you are between 14 years old and 19 years old, your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these terms and is happy for you to access and/or use our Services.

1.4 We can make changes to these terms at any time in accordance with paragraph 14 below and your continued use of our Services shall confirm your acceptance of the updated terms.

^2. About accessing and using our Services

2.1 The specific game rules, scoring rules, controls and guidelines for each Game can be found within the Game itself. Such rules, scoring rules, controls and guidelines form part of these terms and you agree that you shall comply with them in respect of each individual Game which you choose to access and/or play.

2.2 You are responsible for the internet connection and/or mobile charges that you may incur for accessing and/or using our Services. You should ask your mobile operator or internet service provider if you are unsure what these charges will be, before you play.

^2.3 We have the right to withdraw or modify one or more of our Services (in whole or in part) without liability to you from time to time:
•	for technical reasons (such as technical difficulties experienced by us or on the internet);
•	to allow us to improve user experience;
•	where we have legal reasons for doing so (including privacy, data protection or other legal objections to the content or conduct of our Services);
•	because it no longer makes business sense for us to provide the relevant Services (in whole or in part); or
•	because we have altered the services we provide.

^2.4 There may also be times when our Services or any part of them are not available for technical or maintenance related reasons, whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis.

^3. Accounts

3.1 When using our Services you may choose to, and in some instances you will be required to, create an account with us.  If you do create an account with us, you agree that you shall take all steps necessary to protect your log in details and keep them secret.

3.2 You agree that you shall not give your log in details to anyone else or allow anyone else to use your log in details or account.

3.3 In these terms, references to “log in details” or “account” include your log in details and account for any social network that you may allow our Services to interact with.

^3.4 We will be entitled to assume that anyone logging into your account using your log in details is either you or someone logging in with your permission. If you fail to keep your login details secret, or if you share your login details or account with someone else (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any unauthorized purchases) and agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result.

3.5 We will not be responsible to you for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorised person accessing your account and/or using our Services and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorised use, whether fraudulently or otherwise.

^3.6 We reserve the right to delete your account if no activity is conducted by you in relation to the account for 180 or more days. In such event, you will no longer be able to access and/or use any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods (as defined below) associated with that account and no refund will be offered to you in relation to the same.

3.7 You understand that if you delete your account, or if we delete your account in accordance with these terms or on your request, you may lose access to any data previously associated with your account (including without limitation, your progress through our Games and/or the level or score you have reached in our Games and any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods associated with your account).

3.8 Your account is personal to you and you are not entitled to transfer your account to any other person.

^4. Virtual Goods and Virtual Money

4.1 Our Games may include virtual currencies such as Gold Bars (“Virtual Money”) or items or services for use with our Games (“Virtual Goods”). You can buy Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods from us for real money and/or other credits provided that you are the payment account holder. If you are not at least 19 years old, you hereby acknowledge and agree that you have obtained consent from your legal representative for the purchase. You agree that Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods are not transferrable to anyone else and you will not transfer or attempt to transfer any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods to anyone else.

^4.2 You agree that once purchased Virtual Money and Virtual Goods have no monetary value and can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else.

4.3 You do not own Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money but instead you purchase a limited personal revocable licence to use them. Any balance of Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money does not reflect any stored value.

^4.4 If you do not connect your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or a King account, we will not be able to restore any Virtual Money or other data associated with your Game play to a different device if you lose that device or it is damaged. Accordingly, on a device which is not connected in this way:
•	any risk of loss of Virtual Money which you purchase from us is transferred to you upon completion of the purchase. For the purposes of this paragraph 4.4 and paragraph 4.5 below, a ”purchase” is complete at the time our servers validate your purchase and the applicable Virtual Goods and/or Virtual Money are successfully credited to your account on our servers;
•	any risk of loss of Virtual Money that you receive from us without making a purchase is transferred to you at the time the Virtual Money is successfully credited to your account on our servers; and
•	any risk of loss of other data associated with your Game play (including, without limitation, your progress through the Game, or the level or score you have reached in our Games) is transferred to you immediately at the time such Game play data is generated.

^4.5 The data associated with Virtual Goods, whether purchased by you using Virtual Money or otherwise credited or awarded to you, is stored locally on your device and so is not synced between different devices even if you have connected your game play on a device to an account that is linked to either your social network account or King account.  Accordingly, any risk of loss of this data is transferred to you (i) in the case of Virtual Goods which you purchase from us, upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.4 above; and/or (ii) in other cases, at the time the Virtual Goods are credited or awarded to you.

4.6 We reserve the right to control, regulate, change or remove any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without any liability to you.

^4.7 We may revise the pricing for Virtual Goods and Virtual Money offered through the Services at any time. We may limit the total amount of Virtual Goods or Virtual Money that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total amount of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods that may be held in your account in the aggregate. You are only allowed to obtain Virtual Money and Virtual Goods from us or our authorized partners through the Games, and not in any other way.

^4.8 Depending on your platform, any Virtual Goods or Virtual Money purchased is purchased from your platform provider and such purchase will be subject to its terms of service and user agreement. Usage rights for each purchase may differ from item to item. If you are unsure about usage rights you should check with your platform before making a purchase. Unless otherwise shown, content available in any in-game store has the same age rating as the game.

4.9 Without limiting any other paragraph of these terms, if we suspend or terminate your account in accordance with paragraph 7 of these terms you may lose any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods that you may have and we will not compensate you for this loss or make any refund to you.

^4.10 Refund Policy
For a period of 7 days from the date of a purchase of Virtual Money or Virtual Goods using real money (a “Purchase Transaction”), you have a right to request a refund of the purchase price; provided, however, that if any or all of the Virtual Money or Virtual Goods bought in a Purchase Transaction is used within the 7 day period following the Purchase Transaction, you will no longer have a right to request a refund of purchase price for that Purchase Transaction.
Further, if the Virtual Money or Virtual Goods bought in a Purchase Transaction are bundled with other additional Virtual Goods and some or all of those additional Virtual Goods are used, then you will no longer have the right to request a refund of the purchase price for that Purchase Transaction.
^If at any time you receive any Virtual Money or Virtual Goods without payment by you, for instance as a prize or gift, that Virtual Money or Virtual Goods will not be refundable or otherwise capable of being exchanged for real money.
Refunds can be requested through our customer care portal available at https://community.king.com and will be made via the payment partner through which the original purchase was made. The applicable Virtual Money and Virtual Goods which are the subject of a refund request may be removed from your account before the refund is processed.

^6. Playing our Games with others

Some of our Games may also allow you to search for your contacts (for example, by email address) in order to find them to play against or play socially with. We may also display the display names of your past opponents so that you can easily find them to play again.

^6.2 Where King selects another person for you to play with, we may either select at random or use such criteria as we see fit to select your opponent (for example, your past scores, your country, the level you have reached in the Game or your other gameplay activity).

Please note that we will only show your display name publicly, and not your email address; another user must know your email address themselves in order to search for you.

<strong>Ad Identifiers</strong>
<br><br>
We advertise our Services on mobile devices. Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal, device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple’s ID for advertising, or IDFA. When we advertise our Services on mobile devices, we may use your device’s advertising identifier and other information associated with it, which we may hold ourselves or may be provided to us by our advertising network partners, to help us to deliver ads that relate to your interests and to improve and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. You can choose to prevent your device’s ad identifier being used for interest based advertising, or you can reset your device’s ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to device but if you are using an Apple device with iOS 7 you can find the ad identifier settings under Settings>Privacy>Advertising, and if you are using a Google Android device running Android 2.3 or later you can find the ad identifier settings under Settings>Google>Ads.
